> Create and manage locks dynamically in run-time in concurrent software

  

DynaLock is a library to create and manage locks dynamically in run-time in concurrent software, DynaLock hides all concurrency complexities in distributed systems.
DynaLock currently supports Monitor and Semaphore.

## Important
#### DynaLock is currecntly under development and only supports Monitor
#### In a very near future, Semaphore will be added to DynaLock
#### Please contribute in development!

## Installation

  

Package Manager Console - Visual Studio:

  

```sh

Install-Package DynaLock -Version 1.0.3

```

  

Or visit DynaLock's [Nuget][nuget-page] page to get more information.

  

## Usage example

  

DynaLock is easy to use.

  

```cs

using (var monitor = DynaLock.Monitor("enter_a_unique_name")){

	...

	monitor.TryEnter();

	...

	if (monitor.IsLockOwned){

		// Some code

	} else {

		// Some code

	}

	...

}

```

And if you've more domain and would like to have individual context per domain, you could use DynaLock like:

```cs
DynaLock.Context.Monitor domain1_context  =  new  DynaLock.Context.Monitor()
DynaLock.Context.Monitor domain2_context  =  new  DynaLock.Context.Monitor()

using (var monitor = new DynaLock.Monitor(domain1_context, "enter_a_unique_name_in_current_domain")){

	...

	monitor.TryEnter();

	...

	if (monitor.IsLockOwned){

		// Some code

	} else {

		// Some code

	}

	...

}




using (var monitor = new DynaLock.Monitor(domain2_context, "enter_a_unique_name_in_current_domain")){

	...

	monitor.TryEnter();

	...

	if (monitor.IsLockOwned){

		// Some code

	} else {

		// Some code

	}

	...

}

```

In the above senario, all resources are completely seperated per context and CPU(s) will not be wasted anymore. 

Also, you could find working examples in [DynaLock.Test] project.
